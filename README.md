This project, LinguaChat, is created by Esty Schlesinger.
It is currently being built using nodeJS, vanillaJS and express.
Its initial purpose is for language-learners to be able to share progress and interact with fellow humans.
Users will eventually be able to create and posts blogs stating their progress or questions, and viewers who are logged in will be able to comment, like and share.
This idea has potential for expansion.
